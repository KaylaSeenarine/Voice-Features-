# Voice Feature Spectrogram Classifier 🎙️📊

This notebook explores the acoustic analysis of voice recordings using spectrograms and machine learning. It focuses on extracting voice features using `praat-parselmouth` and classifying samples based on those acoustic patterns.

## 💡 Project Goals
- Extract and visualize key voice features (e.g., pitch, jitter, shimmer) using PRAAT via `parselmouth`
- Generate spectrograms for better visual analysis of vocal samples
- Use these features to train a machine learning classifier that can categorize different voice samples
- Lay the groundwork for future tools like SpeechBuddy AI, aimed at supporting speech-language therapy with intelligent voice analysis

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- `praat-parselmouth`: for acoustic feature extraction
- `librosa`: for audio processing and spectrogram generation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: for visualization
- `scikit-learn`: for building the classifier
- `numpy`, `pandas`: for data handling

## 📁 Status
🚧 Work in progress. The classifier is functional with test samples, and ongoing improvements are planned to align with real-world SLP use cases.

## 🌍 Applications
This project is part of a broader initiative to build **SpeechBuddy AI**, a tool for SLPs and researchers that integrates voice AI with practical applications in therapy, including:
- Early speech disorder detection
- Emotion-aware coaching
- Remote voice tracking


✨ Contributions, feedback, and collaborators are welcome—especially in research and applied SLP domains!
